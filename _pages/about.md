# <font face="Times New Roman" > Biography </font>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <p style='text-align: justify;'>
From 2022, Huixu Dong is a “New Hundred-Talent Program” faculty (浙江大学“新百人计划研究员”/博导) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Zhejiang University, and the Director of Robotic perception and Grasp Lab (RPGL) or Grasp Lab(GL) in short. I received the B.Sc degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2013 and obtained Ph.D. degree at Robotics Research Centre (RRC) of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore in 2018 advised by Prof.I-Ming Chen. Before joining Zhejiang University, I was a post-doctoral fellow of Robotics Institute (RI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore.

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am mainly robotic perception and manipulation, including general-purpose grasp, dynamic grasping, dexterous manipulation, and in-hand manipulation. I am interested in studying a challenging problem of efficiently understanding scenarios, reasoning about the grasping trajectory, and carrying out a reliable physical-environment grasping action for constructing an optimized system to perform robust manipulations for domestic, supermarket, warehouse and industrial setting applications. I am motivated by the above problem and working on offering highly resultful solutions through mathematical modeling, gripper design and control, visual perception as well as self-supervision robotic learning.
