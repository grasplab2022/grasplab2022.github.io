# About Me 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <p style='text-align: justify;'>
From 2022, Huixu Dong is a “New Hundred-Talent Program” faculty (浙江大学“新百人计划研究员”/博导) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Zhejiang University, and the Director of Robotic perception and Grasp Lab (RPGL) or Grasp Lab(GL) in short. I received the B.Sc degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2013 and obtained Ph.D. degree at Robotics Research Centre (RRC) of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore in 2018 advised by Prof.I-Ming Chen. Before joining Zhejiang University, I was a post-doctoral fellow of Robotics Institute (RI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore.

# Research Interests 
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am mainly robotic perception and manipulation, including general-purpose grasp, dynamic grasping, dexterous manipulation, and in-hand manipulation. I am interested in studying a challenging problem of efficiently understanding scenarios, reasoning about the grasping trajectory, and carrying out a reliable physical-environment grasping action for constructing an optimized system to perform robust manipulations for domestic, supermarket, warehouse and industrial setting applications. I am motivated by the above problem and working on offering highly resultful solutions through mathematical modeling, gripper design and control, visual perception as well as self-supervision robotic learning.

- *Target* &nbsp;

  It is well-known that a robotic grasping system significantly involves perception, modeling, gripper design and control, motion planning and materials, even emerging technologies such as VR and metaverse. Our research locates in those disciplines of robotic vision, mechatronics and motion planning. Our goal is to develop cutting-edge technologies of robotic perception and grasp to achieve domestic and industrial applications. To this end, we focus on (1) developing grippers with new concepts, new design, new control, new actuator, and new material; (2) studying real-time shape-based and 3D perceptions via mathematical modeling and machine learning; (3) investigating safe, interactive motion planning and grasping synthesis; (4) exploring supervision learning for robots commanding skills. Currently, we are working on robotic tidying, packaging, assembling, picking, placing, and re-grasping projects. 

- *Supervising statement *&nbsp;

  The Grasp Lab is committed to fostering creativity, opening, inclusion, and collaboration among our members with diverse backgrounds. We strive to offer supportive environments for students to implement any novel ideas that break research borders, regardless of specific-purpose applications. Our lab highly encourages students to cooperate with other groups since robotics research is an interdisciplinary and collaborative endeavor. For each incoming member, we advise a suitable research direction and also, have a weekly meeting with each member. We set up a weekly meeting to inspire brainstorming, discuss literature studies and research ideas. Generally, we will allow students to do visiting students overseas such as RRC at NTU in Singapore, RI at CMU in United States, and some universities in Norway, Australia, England, Japan, and Finland.
